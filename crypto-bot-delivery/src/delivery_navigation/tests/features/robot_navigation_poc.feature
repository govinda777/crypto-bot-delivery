Feature: Robot Navigation POC Scenarios
  As a system integrator,
  I want to define conceptual scenarios for robot navigation
  to outline expected behaviors in simulation.

  Background:
    Given the robot simulation is running with a known map
    And the Nav2 stack is active and localized

  Scenario: Robot navigates to a valid goal
    Given the robot is at an initial pose (e.g., 0,0,0)
    When a navigation goal (e.g., 5,5,0) is sent to Nav2
    Then Nav2 should plan a path to the goal
    And the robot should start moving towards the goal
    And the robot should eventually reach the goal location (or close proximity)
    And Nav2 should report success

  Scenario: Robot encounters an unexpected obstacle
    Given the robot is at an initial pose
    And there is an unexpected dynamic obstacle placed on its planned path
    When a navigation goal is sent that requires passing the obstacle's location
    Then Nav2 should initially plan a path
    And the robot should start moving
    And when the robot detects the unexpected obstacle
    Then Nav2 should attempt to re-plan or engage recovery behaviors
    And the robot should either find an alternative path or stop safely if no path is found

  Scenario: Invalid goal is sent
    Given the robot is at an initial pose
    When an invalid navigation goal (e.g., inside a known obstacle on the map) is sent
    Then Nav2 should fail to find a valid path
    And Nav2 should report failure or rejection of the goal

  # Note: Implementing full step definitions for these scenarios in a ROS2/Gazebo
  # environment is complex and requires significant test harness development.
  # These scenarios serve as a conceptual outline for expected system behavior.
